# TODOs

- [x] ~~Switch to use `sh` instead of `subprocess` in all projects and scripts~~ `sh` only supported on Unix-like systems
- [x] Switch to use `rich` for `watchcat` instead of `tqdm`
- [x] Maybe instruct the LLM to respond in Chinese in the prompts?
- [x] Don't refer to the source of a summary by the original content, but by an ID, or the cost and efficiency will be unacceptable.
- [ ] Explore whether we can develop a unified way to manage runtime files of a CLI application (including databases, configurations, logs, resources, etc.) in `phdkit`.
