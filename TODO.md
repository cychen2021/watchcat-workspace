# TODOs

- ~~[ ] Switch to use `sh` instead of `subprocess` in all projects and scripts~~ `sh` only supported on Unix-like systems
- [ ] Switch to use `rich` for `watchcat` instead of `tqdm`
- [ ] Explore whether we can develop a unified way to manage runtime files of a CLI application (including databases, configurations, logs, resources, etc.) in `phdkit`.
